# Rally MKA

Rally MKA is a really old game of mine ported to Go for fun and as a way to try out new concepts.

**WARNING:** This repository is under development, experimentation and redesign and is not guaranteed to be stable or well documented!

## Getting Started

This section describes how to setup the project and run the game locally.

### Prerequisites

* You need [Go 1.15](https://golang.org/dl/) or newer.
* You need the [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) plugin. As the project contains large images and models, this is the official way on how not to clog a repository.

### Setting Up

1. Setup GLFW 3.3 for Go

    Follow the instructions on the [GLFW for Go](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw) repository and make sure you can run the [GLFW examples](https://github.com/go-gl/example).

1. Clone the repository

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mokiat/rally-mka
    cd rally-mka
    ```

    **Note:** As the project uses _go modules_, there is no need to clone or `go get` the project inside your `GOPATH`.

1. Download Go dependencies

    ```sh
    go mod download
    ```

1. Generate game assets

    ```sh
    make assets
    ```

1. Run the game

    ```sh
    make play
    ```

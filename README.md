# Rally MKA [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/mokiat/rally-mka)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/mokiat/rally-mka) [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/mokiat/rally-mka@master.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mokiat/rally-mka@master)

Rally MKA is a really old game/demo of mine ported to Go for fun and as a way to experiment with new concepts. It is also a showcase for the [lacking](https://github.com/mokiat/lacking) game engine.

## User's Guide

### Browser

You can play the game on [itch.io](https://mokiat.itch.io/rally-mka).

The preferred browser is [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), which at the time of writing appears to best support WebGL2, WebAssembly and Game Controllers.

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/mokiat/rally-mka/releases) section for ready-to-use binaries that you can use on your computer.

The requirement is that your OS supports `OpenGL 4.6`.
